            <b><p class="text-center">Tapachula de Córdova y Ordóñez, simply known as Tapachula, is a city and municipality located in the far southeast of the state of Chiapas in Mexico, near the Guatemalan border and the Pacific Ocean. It is one of the most important cities of Chiapas economically as the capital of the agriculturally rich Soconusco region as well as port for trade between Mexico and Central America. The area was originally inhabited by the Mam as a region under the control of the Mam state of Xelaju but was first established as a city by the Aztecs in the 13th century. Most of its economic importance has come since the late 19th century with the establishment of coffee plantations. This agricultural production began a history of migration into the area which continues to this day and has left the city with a significant Asian and German cultural presence as well as large Mayan and Nahua indigenous populations. </p>
          </b>
            <p class="text-center">The name comes from the Nahuatl phrase “Tapachollan” which means ”between the waters”. The official name of the city was changed to "Tapachula de Córdova y Ordóñez" in 1997 in honor to priest Fray Matías de Córdova y Ordóñez.
                The first people to settle in the area migrated from the south in Central America and most likely are the ancestors of today's Mam people. The Olmecs dominated the area, driving many Mam to migrate back south. The Toltecs arrived next but never completely subjugated the native peoples. However, these conquests resulted in the Mam never developing major civilization. The city of Tapachula was founded as a tribute collection center for the Aztecs in 1486 by a military leader named Tiltototl, sent by Ahuziotl to conquer the Soconusco.
                In 1809, shortly before the start of the Mexican War of Independence, Tapachula protested the high rate of taxation to Spanish authorities to no avail. During the war, it was officially declared a town in 1813, and a parish in 1818, with the San Agustín parish church established in 1819. At the end of the war, Tapachula, as capital of the Soconusco, declared its own independence from Spain and Guatemala in 1821, and away from Mexico in 1824.</p>

                Agriculture and livestock abound in Chiapas. It is common to find coffee, fresh dairy products and many types of vegetables in the local gastronomy. I personally love the quesadillas, made with a handmade tortilla with a mixture of cornstarch and flour, stuffed with the famous cheese: "quesillo" and the stew of your choice. Normally there is shredded meat, roast beef, chicken, chorizo, pumpkin flower, pressed pork rinds, among others.
